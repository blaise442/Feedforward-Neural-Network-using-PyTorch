# Feedforward-Neural-Network-using-PyTorch
we implement a Feedforward Neural Network using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The network is trained on the Iris Dataset  using the backpropagation algorithm, which updates the network's weights to minimize the loss between predicted and actual outputs.
